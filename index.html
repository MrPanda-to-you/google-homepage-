<DOCTYPE html> <!-- All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration. The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an information to the browser about what document type to expect. In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:  <!DOCTYPE html> -->
    <html lang="en"> <!-- HTML Language Code Reference: ISO Language Code. In XHTML, the language is declared inside the <html> tag -->
        <head> <!-- The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such as the page <title>, links to CSS (if you choose to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and other metadata (data about the HTML, such as the author, and important keywords that describe the document.) -->
            <title>An attempt to emulate Google with The Odin Project</title> <!-- The <title> tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab. The <title> tag is required in HTML documents! The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results. The <title> element: defines a title in the browser toolbar; provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites; displays a title for the page in search-engine results. Here are some tips for creating good titles: Go for a longer, descriptive title (avoid one- or two-word titles); search engines will display about 50-60 characters of the title, so try not to have titles longer than that; do not use just a list of words as the title (this may reduce the page's position in search results). So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible. -->
            <style >  p {color:blue;} </style> <!-- This is an example on how to establish (inside the <style> element) how HTML elements should render in a browser. The <style> tag is used to define style information (CSS) for a document. -->
            <base href = https://www.google.com /> <!-- The HTML <base> tag is used to specify a base URI, or URL, for relative links. For example, you can set the base URL once at the top of your page in header section, then all subsequent relative links will use that URL as a starting point. -->
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css"> <!-- Link to an external style sheet: The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document (only used if the href attribute is present. The <link> tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource; the <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets; the <link> element is an empty element, it contains attributes only. -->
            <meta content="The content of the meta information"> 
                <meta charset="UTF-8"> <!-- The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world. -->
                <meta name="description" content="My Google with The Odin Project"> <!-- The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data. -->
                <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, Odin Project"> <!-- Specifies a comma-separated list of keywords - relevant to the page (Informs search engines what the page is about). -->
                <meta name="author" content="Sr. Panda"> <!-- Specifies the name of the author of the document. -->
                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <!-- Controls the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page). The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen. You should include this <meta> viewport element in all your web pages.  <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling: The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device). The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser. -->
                <meta name="application-name" content=""> <!-- Specifies the name of the Web application that the page represents. Simple web pages shouldn't define an application-name. -->
